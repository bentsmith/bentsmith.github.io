    <h2 >About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am currently a Senior studying Information Technology and Cyber Security at the University of Southern Maine. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2020. My interests involve cars, guitars, boats, and computers.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have recently taken interest in Virtualization within my studies. This has lead to me taking more classes geared towards virtual machines and even centering my capstone project around the subject. I currently am residing in Maine until my studies are completed, however my hometown is Mystic, Connecticut; which I am also drawn to. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        I currently am a Website Administrator for Stonington Public Schools, and have been working with them and their websites since my graduation from their school system back in 2016.

            <h5>Capstone</h5>
            <p>Small businesses are the backbone of the national economy, making up over 40% of our national GDP. Given technology is advancing at a rather quick rate, most small businesses have made the leap into the cyber world. However, most small businesses are usually quite a few steps behind. Some may not have the budget in order to upgrade or maintain their technological environments. Others may not deem the maintenance or upgrade as mandatory. Today, technology is such an important part of business that it cannot be left out.</p>
            <p>This project looks at a typical technological environment of a small business and analyses possible vulnerabilities or any overlooked items. To determine this, an environment will be built in a virtual machine cluster, which enables a cost effective and efficient way to recreate an environment with several Windows, Linux, and Cisco devices. This environment will help to stand as a “testing ground” for simulated attacks and possible threats. This project seeks find commonly overlooked items or vulnerabilities that a small business may encounter or be at risk of. The project will also suggest best practices for a small business owner to easily follow and adhere. The anticipated result of this study will be to help increase Cyber Security and overall security throughout the organization.</p>
